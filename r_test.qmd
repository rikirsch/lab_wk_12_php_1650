```{r}
x <- 3 

paste("x is", x)
```

I want to run the functions we have created to see how our program is working

```{r}
bikes <- read.csv('/Users/rachelkirsch/Downloads/sample_bike.csv')
my_cleaned_bikes <- bike_data_clean(bikes)

print(arrival_rates(my_cleaned_bikes), n = 10)


# Load the sample dataset
bike_data <- read.csv('/Users/rachelkirsch/Downloads/sample_bike.csv')

# Estimate arrival rates
arrival_rate_ex2 <- estimate_arrival_rates(bike_data)

# View the results
print(arrival_rate_ex2, n = 10)

```
