I want to run the functions we have created to see how our program is working

```{r}
bikes <- read.csv('/Users/rachelkirsch/Downloads/sample_bike.csv')
my_cleaned_bikes <- bike_data_clean(bikes)
data_samp_estim_arriv <- arrival_rates(my_cleaned_bikes)

prefered_placement <- optimize(data_samp_estim_arriv, num_bikes = 100, bike_step_size = 5)
```
